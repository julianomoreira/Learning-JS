## The Base Pattern Library vs. the Adaptive Pattern Library ##

The difference is that the Base is curated and designed to be shared, whereas the Adaptive PL is not. The Adaptive PL grew organically (and therefore chaotically) during the rapid development cycle of Adaptive, and though there have been efforts to organize it, it's still very much a churning "wild west" of UI patterns, changing quickly as sprint-by-sprint development proceeds. The rapid pace of development means that very little of it is documented, since most developers on .com teams work only on their own stuff, and sharing that code outside of .com is understandably not a priority for them.

The Base is a subset extracted from Adaptive, and is meant to be a curated set of carefully maintained, well-documented, a11y-approved UI patterns. That approach makes it much better for sharing with other teams. The Base is meant to be a stable foundation for other teams to build on, and also to eventually take over as the underpinning of .com, by factoring out the concerns of the Base from Adaptive.

## Level of Adoption

We work closely with the .com front-end engineers here in Minneapolis. Patterns and revisions flow back and forth between the Base and Adaptive. Users of the Adaptive Pattern Library include members of the original Fellowship, plus some newcomers: Andrew Fuller, Matt Duffin, Danny Schnacky, Geoff Pursell (yours truly), Abhijeet Mishra, Justin McDowell, and our former fellowship homie who's gone back to India, Mohamed Shaheer, and a few other developers.

The Adaptive Pattern Library has been adopted by:
* Target.com, which was recently divided into product teams (Discover, Transaction, etc).
* Axiom, which is an internal tool that needs to re-implement much of the .com UI
* Target Creative's Master Brand Site
* Marketing Campaigns - Target Creative uses the Adaptive Pattern Library to develop these experiences on-platform

The Base, which is much younger, having seen its first release less than a month ago, has been adopted by:
* the Registry & List web team
* Senthil's team (what they do, we're not sure)

In an ideal world, we would have one PL to maintain and support, in this case the Base. Currently, we're trying to keep the Base in sync with Adaptive PL which duplicates our effort every time there's change to the Base or Adaptive.

## The golden plan

In order for us to impact Target's bottom line, we'd need to have one source of truth, in this case the Base. Some of the work has been done to remove product specific patterns from the Base but adoption has been a challenge.

Once we merge efforts, we'd need product teams to be aware of the change and encourage them to use the Base. The challenge has been to get India to adopt our PL in its full capacity. We'd need support from India TTS leaders in order for us to have a source of truth that fuels Target's web property.
