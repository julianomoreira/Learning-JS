# React

React is pretty much the ability to write individual components or views. A component or view produces HTML.

Create component, then render component on the DOM.

JSX is a dialet transpiled on the page. It makes our code legible.

Every React component that is class-based must have a render function.

Each class component has its own state.

State is a plain JS object that is used to record and react to user events. Each class-based component has its own state object. Whenever a component state changes it re-renders and it forces all its children to re-render as well.
